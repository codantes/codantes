I am a Frontend developer, Ethereum smart contract developer, and Web3 integration specialist. I love building and designing products, and I am really hoping to work closely with UI development.

I have been working on front-end projects using React.js and Next.js, and my passion for UI design is what drives me every day. I have worked on React-based web applications, mobile websites, and web apps with amazing user experience.

I also work closely with designers and backend developers to create the frontend for the community-based product. I redesigned the frontend architecture and collaborated on the node.js backend for new features so that more people could use this product without any hassle.
