I'm a full stack web developer and native app developer with a passion for designing and building great user experiences. I have experience working with React, Next.js, Node.js, and various other web development technologies.

Recently, I've been focusing on expanding my skills to include native app development using technologies like React Native and Flutter. I believe that mobile apps are a powerful tool for engaging with users and building communities, and I'm excited to explore this area further.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm also experienced in collaborating with designers and other developers to bring projects to life. I'm always eager to learn and try new things, and I'm constantly looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects and collaborate with others in the tech community
